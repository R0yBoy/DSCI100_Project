2. I like Zelda
3. Likelyhood of a person graduating for UBC
4. How much you initally earn in your first year after graduation?
5. Catching the bus at the optimal time (So you gan get on right when you get there)  
    - Vancouver
    - Toronto
    - London England
    - Berlin
6. Something COVID-19 Related
    - Focus on Vancouver, based on where you live and other factors, what are the chances you get COVID-19?
