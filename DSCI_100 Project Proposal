Title: Study time of subject vs. of prerequisites: which one has a greater impact on exam performance? 
Introduction: The modeling of relative knowledge levels for students within different domains is essential for web-based adaptive learning services. Adaptive learning is a system where teaching is built around the student, adjusting itself based on the needs of students to provide an efficient learning experience. This is done through the use of AI, the AI uses different variables to decide the knowledge level of the student and helps them determine their most efficient learning schedule. This poses the question, which of the following variables contributes more to the exam performance  of students on the goal object, their study time of prerequisite subjects or their study time of the tested subject? To answer this question, we will be utilizing the “User Knowledge Modeling” dataset created by Hamdi Tolga Kahraman et al.
